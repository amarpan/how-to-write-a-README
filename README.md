<h4>
The README is often the most overlooked and underestimated aspect of a General Assembly SEI project, frequently left until the very last minute.
And yet, it is what employers directly look at when assessing one's technical competency as a developer. <hr/>

Thus, in today's tutorial, we'll take a look at how to write and design a GA SEI README that would make any employer blush. <hr/>

 ***This tutorial assumes you already have some semblance of a README. If you're starting from scratch, however, download my blank skeleton template [here](https://github.com/amarpan/blank-README-template/blob/main/README.md).       

***For a quick review on how to use Markdown, go [here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).   

## <h2  align="center">Description</h2>
 <img src="./images/BAD-DESCRIPTION.png">    
 
 <img src="./images/GOOD-DESCRIPTION.png">
 
|            | Instructions |
|------------|--------------|
| Note:      | Each `#` stands for a header of that number in HTML. | 
|            | Ex. `#` is equivalent to `<h1>` |
|            | Ex. `######` is equivalent to `<h6>`|
| Note:      | Integrate styling with `<h1 align="center">` to center text. |
| Note:      | Add your deployed link directly to the top here - many users won't scroll all the way down to find it.
| Note:      | Use emojis by typing in `:emojiname:` Ex. `:school:` ---> :school:
|         | While emojis automatically show on GitHub, to see them on VS Code one needs to install an extension like [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-emoji).
|            | A full list of available emojis can be found [here](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md).

|            | Instructions |
|------------|--------------|
| Note:      | To set up a  table, use |
|            | `\| Description \| Screenshot\|` |
|            |`\|-------------\|-----------\|`|
|            |`\|   caption   \|   image   \|`|
| Note:      | Whatever is placed in between `<details></details>` will be hidden beneath a closed drop-down menu, until its arrow is clicked on. The title for this should be placed in between `<summary></summary>`. 
| Note:      | To have a drop-down menu display by default without the user having to click it, add the word 'open' to the details tag.
|            |Ex. `<details>`  -->  `<details open>` 
| Note:      |Image dimensions can also be resized by specifying width and height.| 
|            |Ex. `<img src="" width="300" height="400">`| 

## <h2  align="center">Technologies Used</h2>
 <img src="./images/BAD-TECHNOLOGIES-USED.png">    
 <img src="./images/GOOD-TECHNOLOGIES-USED.png">    

|            | Instructions |
|------------|--------------|
| Note:      | Separate each technology used with a `\|` (vertical bar) to avoid making your README unnecessarily lengthy.

## <h2  align="center">Getting Started</h2>
 <img src="./images/BAD-GETTING-STARTED.png">    
 <img src="./images/GOOD-GETTING-STARTED.png">    

|            | Instructions |
|------------|--------------|
| Note:      | Use number lists as opposed to lengthy paragraphs to make sure this section is easily readable.
| Note:      | Put your links in more drop-down menus using `<details open>` and `<summary>`.
| Note:      | Try to choose something simple and memorable when choosing your Heroku URL / link name.

## <h2  align="center">Next Steps</h2>
 <img src="./images/BAD-NEXT-STEPS.png">    
 <img src="./images/GOOD-NEXT-STEPS.png">    

|            | Instructions |
|------------|--------------|
| Note:      | Try to avoid using the word "icebox", as most non-technical users probably won't know what this means.
| Note:      | Use bullet points rather than paragraphs to make it immediately clear what each new feature would be.

<h4>Today we learned how to convert an average README into one that instantly catches the eyes of employers.</h4>   
 
 <h4>Despite not being able to use proper CSS to change colors and styles, we can actually add a lot of customization and fine-tuning with the right Markdown shortcuts.</h4>
