# How to Fix a README
The README is often the most overlooked and underrated aspect of a web dev project. And yet, it is what employers directly look at when assessing one's technical competency as a software engineer.

Thus, today we'll take a look at how to clean-up an existing README so that it looks presentable.

## <h2  align="center">Header - Bad vs Good</h2>

|            | Instructions |
|------------|--------------|
| Note:      | Integrate styling with `<h1 align="center">` to center text |
| Note:      | Use emojis by typing in `:emojiname:` Ex. `:school:` ---> :school:

|            | Instructions |
|------------|--------------|
| Note:      | To set up a  table, use `\| Description \| Screenshot \| ` followed by `\|---\|---\|` followed by `\| <caption> \| <image> \|`
| Note:      | Whatever is placed in between `<details></details> ` will be put into a closed drop-down menu. The title for this should be placed in between `<summary></summary>` 
| Note:      | To have a drop-down menu display by default without the user having to click it, add `<details open>` 

## <h2  align="center">Getting Started - Bad vs Good</h2>
 <img src="./images/BAD-GETTING-STARTED.png">    
 <img src="./images/GOOD-GETTING-STARTED.png">    

|            | Instructions |
|------------|--------------|
| Note:      | Use number lists as opposed to lengthy paragraphs to make sure this section is easily readable

## <h2  align="center">Technologies Used - Bad vs Good</h2>
 <img src="./images/BAD-TECHNOLOGIES-USED.png">    
 <img src="./images/GOOD-TECHNOLOGIES-USED.png">    

|            | Instructions |
|------------|--------------|
| Note:      | Separate each technology used with a `\|` to avoid making your README unnecessarily long
