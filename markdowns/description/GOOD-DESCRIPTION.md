## :pencil: Description

Simon is a classic short-term memory game where the user is expected to match the random color pattern selected by the computer. Each game starts at Lvl 1 with the computer first selecting a single color, and then the user selecting that same color. At each subsequent level, another color is added to the pattern, making the correct pattern increasingly harder to remember.
