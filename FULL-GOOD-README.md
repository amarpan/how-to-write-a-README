## Introduction
Meet Your Classmates is an Instagram-clone and hub where students can get to know and relate to their peers via completion of short 3-question mini-surveys. By learning about others' backgrounds, previous experiences, and interests, an atmosphere of community is created that is conducive to higher levels of learning and success.
